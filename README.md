The term "Web3 project" is relatively new and there is no one definitive translation. However, the translation provided above is a good starting point.
The term "basic libraries" is also somewhat vague. However, the examples provided above should give you a good idea of the types of libraries that are typically included in Web3 projects.
The term "business reference code" is more specific. However, it is still important to note that the code provided in these examples is just that - examples. You will need to adapt the code to meet the specific needs of your project.
